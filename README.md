# Educational Projects in Python
**This repository contains Python scripts. Those scripts were performed with educational purpose, which is to practice one or several studying modules and consolidate the result as an active professional skill.** 

## Brief projects' description (ordered by completion):

### 4. Matplotlib graph: ["Limes sale"](limes_sale.py)

Within this small project, I acted as a data analyst for an online lime retailer called "Sublime Limes". One of the product managers at Sublime Limes would like to gain insight into the customers and their sales habits. So using Matplotlib, I have created different line graphs to communicate this information.

Resulting graphs:

### 3.**"Filtering in SQL vs. Filtering in Python"**

In a file [script_for_backup.py](script_for_backup.py) the is a program that creates a new database called **backup.db** with the same structure as **original.db** (see previous item) and copies all the values greater than 20.0 from **original.db** to **backup.db**. 
The main question is which approach is faster: 
- filtering values in the query;
- or reading everything into memory and filtering in Python? 

After launching 2 files one should be able to compare results.

### 2.**"Filling a Table vs. Printing Values"**

In a file [random.py](random.py) there is a program that creates a new database in a file **original.db** containing a single table called **'pressure'**, with a single field called **'reading'**. The program also inserts 100,000 random numbers between `10.0` and `25.0`. 
Qestions: 
- How long does it take this program to run? 
- How long does it take to run a program that simply writes those random numbers to a file? The result described in the 2nd variant can be seen if one runs file named [random2.py](random2.py).

After launching 2 files one should be able to compare results.

### 1. Lists, Functions, and Dictionaries: ["Hurricanes"](hurricanes.py)
    
The goal of this project is to find extremes among data points of magor hurricanes via arranging data in dictionaries and lists for calculations convenience and performing sorting.
